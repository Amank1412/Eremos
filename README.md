# ​ Eremos — Autonomous Swarm Agents for On-Chain Signal Mastery

![Eremos](docs/banner2.png)

Lightweight, modular agents that surface the most hidden on-chain signals—perfectly tuned for real-time insight and developer workflows.

---

##  Why You Should Care

| Problem | Eremos Solution |
|--------|------------------|
| High noise from on-chain data | Swarm agents emit only clean, structured signals |
| Lack of early visibility into funding or deployment events | Detects early wallet clusters, contract launches, and anomalies |
| Poor integration in dev workflows | Easy observability using structured JSON + TypeScript tooling |

  <em>Theron — agent-zero, pattern-sensitive, quietly watching for anomalies.</em>

##  Why Eremos Wins

1. **True early detection** — guards against silent funding and dark launches.  
2. **Developer-first design** — instantly consumable signals in JSON/TS format.  
3. **Clean, mythic branding** — unique aesthetic (Theron, the mythos) that’s memorable.

---

##  Features

- **Modular Agents** — isolated logic for wallet behavior, contract creation, anomaly detection
- **Signal Emission** — concise, structured signaling for downstream workflows
- **Swarm Architecture** — multiple watchers operating independently
- **Launch Wallet Detection** — trace new funded wallets, tag deploy events, flag high-confidence launches
- **Ghost Watcher** — long-silent wallets that awaken suddenly are caught
- **Minimal Noise** — only the signal data matters—no log spam

---

##  Signal Example

Example alert from `agent-observer` on detecting a live token deployment:

```ts
[agent-observer] → fresh funding from kraken (6Yxk…P2M8) at 04:41:12Z
[agent-observer] → contract interaction detected 4s later
...
{
  agent: "Observer",
  type: "launch_detected",
  glyph: "Δ",
  hash: "sig_c7f9a3d2bc",
  timestamp: "2025-06-12T04:41:25Z",
  source: "agent-observer",
  confidence: 0.91
}
